# memoryVol
A GUI-Based tool based on Volatility CLI-Based memory analysis and forensics tool

As a project, we have built a graphical user interface-based memory analysis tool, which 
is built on top of the CLI-based tool called “Volatility Framework.” This is going to be very user 
friendly to anyone who is using it.
